      "Towards Automatic Distinction between Specialized and Non-Specialized Occurrences of Verbs in Medical Corpora. The medical field gathers people of different social statuses, such as students, pharmacists, managers, biologists, nurses and mainly medical doctors and patients, who represent the main actors. Despite their different levels of expertise, these actors need to interact and understand each other but the communication is not always easy and effective. This paper describes a method for a contrastive automatic analysis of verbs in medical corpora, based on the semantic annotation of the verbs nominal co-occurents. The corpora used are specialized in cardiology and distinguished according to their levels of expertise (high and low). The semantic annotation of these corpora is performed by using an existing medical terminology. The results indicate that the same verbs occurring in the two corpora show different specialization levels, which are indicated by the words (nouns and adjectives derived from medical terms) they occur with.\n",

Translation and Interpreting students at the Universidad de MÃ¡laga are offered the possibility to take an English-Spanish Literary Translation module, which epitomises the need for debate in the field of Humanities. Sadly enough, implementation of course methodology is rendered very difficult or impossible owing to time restrictions and overcrowded classrooms. It is our contention that the setting up of a web site may solve some of these issues. We intend to provide both students and the literary translation-aware Internet audience with an integrated, scalable, multifunctional debate forum. Project contents will include a detailed course description, relevant reference materials and interaction services (mailing list, debate forum and chat rooms). This is obviously without limitation, as the Forum is open to any other contents that users may consider necessary or convenient, with a view to a more interdisciplinary approach, further research on the field of Literary Translation and future developments within the project framework.\n",

We present parallel gaze data obtained from adult readers with autism and a control group of neurotypical readers and show that the former required higher cognitive effort to comprehend the texts as evidenced by three gaze-based measures. We divide all words into four classes based on their viewing times for both groups and investigate the relationship between longer viewing times and word length, word frequency, and four cognitively-based measures (word concreteness, familiarity, age of acquisition and imagability).\n",

This paper describes novel models tailored for a new application, that of extracting the symptoms mentioned in clinical conversations along with their status. Lack of any publicly available corpus in this privacy-sensitive domain led us to develop our own corpus, consisting of about 3K conversations annotated by professional medical scribes. We propose two novel deep learning approaches to infer the symptom names and their status: (1) a new hierarchical span-attribute tagging (SA-T) model, trained using curriculum learning, and (2) a variant of sequence-to-sequence model which decodes the symptoms and their status from a few speaker turns within a sliding window over the conversation. This task stems from a realistic application of assisting medical providers in capturing symptoms mentioned by patients from their clinical conversations. To reflect this application, we define multiple metrics. From inter-rater agreement, we find that the task is inherently difficult. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on several contrasting conditions and observe that the performance of the models range from an F-score of 0.5 to 0.8 depending on the condition. Our analysis not only reveals the inherent challenges of the task, but also provides useful directions to improve the models.\n",

We aim to address some of these gaps by extending and developing upon the literature to design a question answering system that can decide on the most appropriate answers for patients attempting to self-diagnose while including the ability to abstain from answering when confidence is low.\n",

Inspired by the unsupervised spoken term discovery in speech processing field, we investigate whether a similar approach can be applied in sign language to discover repeating lexical units. We adapt an algorithm that is designed for spoken term discovery by using hand shape and pose features instead of speech features.

      "Conversation Initiation by Diverse News Contents Introduction. In our everyday chitchat , there is a conversation initiator, who proactively casts an initial utterance to start chatting. However, most existing conversation systems cannot play this role. Previous studies on conversation systems assume that the user always initiates conversation, and have placed emphasis on how to respond to the given user's utterance. As a result, existing conversation systems become passive. Namely they continue waiting until being spoken to by the users. In this paper, we consider the system as a conversation initiator and propose a novel task of generating the initial utterance in open-domain non-task-oriented conversation. Here, in order not to make users bored, it is necessary to generate diverse utterances to initiate conversation without relying on boilerplate utterances like greetings. To this end, we propose to generate initial utterance by summarizing and chatting about news articles, which provide fresh and various contents everyday. To address the lack of the training data for this task, we constructed a novel largescale dataset through crowd-sourcing. We also analyzed the dataset in detail to examine how humans initiate conversations (the dataset will be released to facilitate future research activities). We present several approaches to conversation initiation including information retrieval based and generation based models. Experimental results showed that the proposed models trained on our dataset performed reasonably well and outperformed baselines that utilize automatically collected training data in both automatic and manual evaluation. * This work was done during research internship at Yahoo Japan Corporation. 1 \"Conversation\" in this paper refers to open-domain nontask-oriented conversations and chitchat .\n",

      "Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Networks: A Chinese Corpus, Systems and an Explainable Tool. Recently, more and more data have been generated in the online world, filled with offensive language such as threats, swear words or straightforward insults. It is disgraceful for a progressive society, and then the question arises on how language resources and technologies can cope with this challenge. However, previous work only analyzes the problem as a whole but fails to detect particular types of offensive content in a more fine-grained way, mainly because of the lack of annotated data. In this work, we present a densely annotated data-set COLA (Categorizing Offensive LAnguage), consists of fine-grained insulting language, antisocial language and illegal language. We study different strategies for automatically identifying offensive language on COLA data. Further, we design a capsule system with hierarchical attention to aggregate and fully utilize information, which obtains a state-of-the-art result. Results from experiments prove that our hierarchical attention capsule network (HACN) performs significantly better than existing methods in offensive classification with the precision of 94.37% and recall of 95.28%. We also explain what our model has learned with an explanation tool called Integrated Gradients. Meanwhile, our system's processing speed can handle each sentence in 10msec, suggesting the potential for efficient deployment in real situations.\n",

      "Boosting Low-Resource Biomedical QA via Entity-Aware Masking Strategies. Biomedical question-answering (QA) has gained increased attention for its capability to provide users with high-quality information from a vast scientific literature. Although an increasing number of biomedical QA datasets has been recently made available, those resources are still rather limited and expensive to produce. Transfer learning via pre-trained language models (LMs) has been shown as a promising approach to leverage existing general-purpose knowledge. However, finetuning these large models can be costly and time consuming, often yielding limited benefits when adapting to specific themes of specialised domains, such as the COVID-19 literature. To bootstrap further their domain adaptation, we propose a simple yet unexplored approach, which we call biomedical entity-aware masking (BEM). We encourage masked language models to learn entity-centric knowledge based on the pivotal entities characterizing the domain at hand, and employ those entities to drive the LM fine-tuning. The resulting strategy is a downstream process applicable to a wide variety of masked LMs, not requiring additional memory or components in the neural architectures. Experimental results show performance on par with state-of-the-art models on several biomedical QA datasets.\n",

In cases where analyzers were not available to do high-quality automatic annotations, layers were manually doubleannotated and adjudicated by trained annotators.

      "Memes in the Wild: Assessing the Generalizability of the Hateful Memes Challenge Dataset. Hateful memes pose a unique challenge for current machine learning systems because their message is derived from both text-and visual-modalities. To this effect, Facebook released the Hateful Memes Challenge, a dataset of memes with pre-extracted text captions, but it is unclear whether these synthetic examples generalize to 'memes in the wild'. In this paper, we collect hateful and non-hateful memes from Pinterest to evaluate out-of-sample performance on models pre-trained on the Facebook dataset. We find that memes in the wild differ in two key aspects: 1) Captions must be extracted via OCR, injecting noise and diminishing performance of multimodal models, and 2) Memes are more diverse than 'traditional memes', including screenshots of conversations or text on a plain background. This paper thus serves as a reality check for the current benchmark of hateful meme detection and its applicability for detecting real world hate.\n",

This paper reports on the main phases of a research which aims at enhancing a maritime terminological database by means of a set of terms belonging to meteorology. The structure of the terminological database, according to EuroWordNet/ItalWordNet model is described; the criteria used to build corpora of specialized texts are explained as well as the use of the corpora as source for term selection and extraction. The contribution of the semantic databases is taken into account: on the one hand, the most recent version of the Princeton WordNet has been exploited as reference for comparing and evaluating synsets; on the other hand, the Italian WordNet has been employed as source for exporting synsets to be coded in the terminological resource. The set of semantic relations useful to codify new terms belonging to the discipline of meteorology is examined, revising the semantic relations provided by the IWN model, introducing new relations which are more suitably tailored to specific requirements either scientific or pragmatic. The need for a particular relation is highlighted to represent the mental association which is made when a term intuitively recalls another term, but they are neither synonyms nor connected by means of a hyperonymy/hyponymy relation.\n",

Each interview has been digitized and extensively catalogued by subject matter experts, thus producing a remarkably rich collection for the application of machine learning techniques. Automatic speech recognition techniques originally developed for the domain of conversational telephone speech were adapted to process these materials with word error rates that are adequate to provide useful features to support interactive search and automated clustering, boundary detection, and topic classification tasks. As I describe our results, I will focus particularly on the evaluation methods that that we have used to assess the potential utility of this technology. I'll conclude with some remarks about possible future directions for research on applying new technologies to improve intellectual access to oral history and other spoken word collections.\n",

This work examines the impact of crosslinguistic transfer on grammatical errors in English as Second Language (ESL) texts. Using a computational framework that formalizes the theory of Contrastive Analysis (CA), we demonstrate that language specific error distributions in ESL writing can be predicted from the typological properties of the native language and their relation to the typology of English. Our typology driven model enables to obtain accurate estimates of such distributions without access to any ESL data for the target languages. Furthermore, we present a strategy for adjusting our method to low-resource languages that lack typological documentation using a bootstrapping approach which approximates native language typology from ESL texts. Finally, we show that our framework is instrumental for linguistic inquiry seeking to identify first language factors that contribute to a wide range of difficulties in second language acquisition.\n",

Among the known tasks related to offensive speech detection, this is the first task to detect offensive comments posted in social media comments in the Dravidian language. The task organizer team provided us with the code-mixing task data set mainly composed of three different languages: Malayalam, Kannada, and Tamil. The tasks on the code mixed data in these three different languages can be seen as three different comment/post-level classification tasks. The task on the Malayalam data set is a five-category classification task, and the Kannada and Tamil language data sets are two six-category classification tasks. Based on our analysis of the task description and task data set, we chose to use the multilingual BERT model to complete this task.

Further, we create a version of the BioInfer corpus with syntactic annotation in this scheme. We present an application-oriented evaluation of the transformation and assess the suitability of the scheme and our conversion to the unification of the syntactic annotations of BioInfer and the GENIA Treebank.

We evaluate the proposed approach on different event types. Results show that the participantbased approach can effectively capture the sub-events that have otherwise been shadowed by the long-tail of other dominant sub-events, yielding summaries with considerably better coverage than the state-of-the-art.\n",

We examine how additional contextual signals (from previous messages, time, and subject) affect the performance of a commercial text prediction model. We compare contextual text prediction in chat and email messages from two of the largest commercial platforms Microsoft Teams and Outlook, finding that contextual signals contribute to performance differently between these scenarios. On emails, time context is most beneficial with small relative gains of 2% over baseline. Whereas, in chat scenarios, using a tailored set of previous messages as context yields relative improvements over the baseline between 9.3% and 18.6% across various critical serviceoriented text prediction metrics.\n",

      "Collaborative Data Relabeling for Robust and Diverse Voice Apps Recommendation in Intelligent Personal Assistants. Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple Siri extend their built-in capabilities by supporting voice apps developed by third-party developers. Sometimes the smart assistant is not able to successfully respond to user voice commands (aka utterances). There are many reasons including automatic speech recognition (ASR) error, natural language understanding (NLU) error, routing utterances to an irrelevant voice app or simply that the user is asking for a capability that is not supported yet. The failure to handle a voice command leads to customer frustration. In this paper, we introduce a fallback skill recommendation system to suggest a voice app to a customer for an unhandled voice command. One of the prominent challenges of developing a skill recommender system for IPAs is partial observation. To solve the partial observation problem, we propose collaborative data relabeling (CDR) method. In addition, CDR also improves the diversity of the recommended skills. We evaluate the proposed method both offline and online. The offline evaluation results show that the proposed system outperforms the baselines. The online A/B testing results show significant gain of customer experience metrics.\n",

We model a user profile as the probabilities of translation of query to document in this noisy channel using the relevance feedback obtained from the user. The user profile thus learnt is applied in a re-ranking phase to rescore the search results retrieved using an underlying search engine. We evaluate our approach by conducting experiments using relevance feedback data collected from users using a popular search engine. The results have shown improvement over baseline, proving that our approach can be applied to personalization of web search.

We start with simple LSTM baselines and move to an autoregressive transformer decoder to predict long continuous propaganda spans for the first subtask. We also adopt an approach from relation extraction by enveloping spans mentioned above with special tokens for the second subtask of propaganda technique classification. Our models report an F-score of 44.6% and a micro-averaged F-score of 58.2% for those tasks accordingly.\n",

      "Interpretable Propaganda Detection in News Articles. Online users today are exposed to misleading and propagandistic news articles and media posts on a daily basis. To counter thus, a number of approaches have been designed aiming to achieve a healthier and safer online news and media consumption. Automatic systems are able to support humans in detecting such content; yet, a major impediment to their broad adoption is that besides being accurate, the decisions of such systems need also to be interpretable in order to be trusted and widely adopted by users. Since misleading and propagandistic content influences readers through the use of a number of deception techniques, we propose to detect and to show the use of such techniques as a way to offer interpretability. In particular, we define qualitatively descriptive features and we analyze their suitability for detecting deception techniques. We further show that our interpretable features can be easily combined with pre-trained language models, yielding state-of-the-art results.\n",

Though it can be viewed as multi-label document classification, the coding problem has the interesting property that most code assignments can be supported by a single phrase found in the input document. We propose a Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Model (LT-HMM) that leverages these phrases to improve coding accuracy. The LT-HMM works in two stages: first, a lexical match is performed against a term dictionary to collect a set of candidate codes for a document. Next, a discriminative HMM selects the best subset of codes to assign to the document by tagging candidates as present or absent. By confirming codes proposed by a dictionary, the LT-HMM can share features across codes, enabling strong performance even on rare codes. In fact, we are able to recover codes that do not occur in the training set at all. Our approach achieves the best ever performance on the 2007 Medical NLP Challenge test set, with an F-measure of 89.84.\n",

In this work, we aim at building faceted concept hierarchies from scientific literature. Hierarchy construction methods heavily rely on hypernym detection, however, the faceted relations are parent-to-child links but the hypernym relation is a multi-hop, i.e., ancestor-todescendent link with a specific facet \"type-of\". We use information extraction techniques to find synonyms, sibling concepts, and ancestordescendent relations from a data science corpus. And we propose a hierarchy growth algorithm to infer the parent-child links from the three types of relationships. It resolves conflicts by maintaining the acyclic structure of a hierarchy.\n",

To get promising adaptation results, we need to find effective ways to transfer knowledge learned in source domain and leverage useful domain specific information from target domain at the same time. This paper describes our winning contribution to SemEval 2021 Task 10: Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Semantic Processing.

      "Evaluating productivity gains of hybrid ASR-MT systems for translation dictation.. This paper is about Translation Dictation with ASR, that is, the use of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by human translators, in order to dictate translations. We are particularly interested in the productivity gains that this could provide over conventional keyboard input, and ways in which such gains might be increased through a combination of ASR and Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). In this hybrid technology, the source language text is presented to both the human translator and a SMT system. The latter produces Nbest translations hypotheses, which are then used to fine tune the ASR language model and vocabulary towards utterances which are probable translations of source text sentences. We conducted an ergonomic experiment with eight professional translators dictating into French, using a top of the line offthe-shelf ASR system (Dragon NatuallySpeaking 8). We found that the ASR system had an average Word Error Rate (WER) of 11.7%, and that translation using this system did not provide statistically significant productivity increases over keyboard input, when following the manufacturer recommended procedure for error correction. However, we found indications that, even in its current imperfect state, French ASR might be beneficial to translators who are already used to dictation (either with ASR or a dictaphone), but more focused experiments are needed to confirm this. We also found that dictation using an ASR with WER of 4% or less would have resulted in statistically significant (p < 0.6) productivity gains in the order of 25.1% to 44.9% Translated Words Per Minute. We also evaluated the extent to which the limited manufacturer provided Domain Adaptation features could be used to positively bias the ASR using SMT hypotheses. We found that the relative gains in WER were much lower than has been reported in the literature for tighter integration of SMT with ASR, pointing the advantages of tight integration approaches and the need for more research in that area.\n",

A relevant question hence is whether and how such form of imbalanced news coverage can be exposed. The research presented in this paper addresses not only the automatic detection of bias but goes one step further in that it explores how political bias and unfairness are manifested linguistically. In this regard we utilize a new corpus of 6964 news articles with labels derived from adfontesmedia.com and develop a neural model for bias assessment.

      "Enhancing Dialogue Symptom Diagnosis with Global Attention and Symptom Graph. Symptom diagnosis is a challenging yet profound problem in natural language processing. Most previous research focus on investigating the standard electronic medical records for symptom diagnosis, while the dialogues between doctors and patients that contain more rich information are not well studied. In this paper, we first construct a dialogue symptom diagnosis dataset based on an online medical forum with a large amount of dialogues between patients and doctors. Then, we provide some benchmark models on this dataset to boost the research of dialogue symptom diagnosis. In order to further enhance the performance of symptom diagnosis over dialogues, we propose a global attention mechanism to capture more symptom related information, and build a symptom graph to model the associations between symptoms rather than treating each symptom independently. Experimental results show that both the global attention and symptom graph are effective to boost dialogue symptom diagnosis. In particular, our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the constructed dataset.\n",

In this article, we propose a method for automatic extraction of reasoning chains that contain information used by the author of a report to analyse the problem at hand. For this purpose, we developed a graph-based text representation that makes the relations between textual units explicit.

In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm for solving the textbook question answering (TQA) task which describes more realistic QA problems compared to other recent tasks. We mainly focus on two related issues with analysis of the TQA dataset. First, solving the TQA problems requires to comprehend multimodal contexts in complicated input data. To tackle this issue of extracting knowledge features from long text lessons and merging them with visual features, we establish a context graph from texts and images, and propose a new module f-GCN based on graph convolutional networks (GCN). Second, scientific terms are not spread over the chapters and subjects are split in the TQA dataset. To overcome this so called 'out-of-domain' issue, before learning QA problems, we introduce a novel self-supervised open-set learning process without any annotations. The experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ablation studies validate that both methods of incorporating f-GCN for extracting knowledge from multi-modal contexts and our newly proposed self-supervised learning process are effective for TQA problems.\n",

We present different strategies grounded in linguistics of sign language that inform how intensity modifiers can be represented in gloss annotations. To employ our strategies, we first annotate a subset of the benchmark PHOENIX-14T, a German Sign Language dataset, with different levels of intensification. We then use a supervised intensity tagger to extend the annotated dataset and obtain labels for the remaining portion of it. This enhanced dataset is then used to train state-of-the-art transformer models for sign language generation. We find that our efforts in intensification modeling yield better results when evaluated with automatic metrics.

In this paper, we investigate gender-related asymmetries in Wikipedia titles from all domains. We assess that for only half of gender-related articles, i.e., articles with words such as women or male in their titles, symmetrical counterparts describing the same concept for the other gender (and clearly stating it in their titles) exist. Among the remaining imbalanced cases, the vast majority of articles concern sports-and social-related issues.

The blurry line between nefarious fake news and protected-speech satire has been a notorious struggle for social media platforms. Further to the efforts of reducing exposure to misinformation on social media, purveyors of fake news have begun to masquerade as satire sites to avoid being demoted. In this work, we address the challenge of automatically classifying fake news versus satire. Previous work have studied whether fake news and satire can be distinguished based on language differences. Contrary to fake news, satire stories are usually humorous and carry some political or social message. We hypothesize that these nuances could be identified using semantic and linguistic cues. Consequently, we train a machine learning method using semantic representation, with a state-of-the-art contextual language model, and with linguistic features based on textual coherence metrics. Empirical evaluation attests to the merits of our approach compared to the language-based baseline and sheds light on the nuances between fake news and satire. As avenues for future work, we consider studying additional linguistic features related to the humor aspect, and enriching the data with current news events, to help identify a political or social message.\n",

Usually, there is a low agreement among raters in annotating emotions and, surprisingly, emotion recognition is higher in a condition of modality deprivation (i. e. only acoustic or only visual modality vs. bimodal display of emotion). Because of these previous results, we collected a corpus in which \"emotive\" tokens are pointed out during the recordings by psychophysiological indexes (ElectroCardioGram, and Galvanic Skin Conductance). From the output values of these indexes a general recognition of each emotion arousal is allowed. After this selection we will annotate emotive interactions with our multimodal annotation scheme, performing a kappa statistic on annotation results to validate our coding scheme. In the near future, a logistic regression on annotated data will be performed to find out correlations between cooperation and negative emotions. A final step will be an fMRI experiment on emotion recognition of blended emotions from face displays.\n",

With the increase of users on social media platforms, manipulating or provoking masses of people has become a piece of cake. This spread of hatred among people, which has become a loophole for freedom of speech, must be minimized. Hence, it is essential to have a system that automatically classifies the hatred content, especially on social media, to take it down. This paper presents a simple modular pipeline classifier with BERT embeddings and attention mechanism to classify hope speech content in the Hope Speech Detection shared task for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion-ACL 2022. Our system submission ranks fourth with an F1-score of 0.84. We release our code-base here https: //github.com/Deepanshu-beep/ hope-speech-attention.\n",

Sockpuppets are fake accounts created by malicious users to bypass Wikipedia's regulations. Our dataset is composed of the comments made by the editors on the talk pages. To overcome the limitations of the short lengths of these comments, we use an voting scheme to combine predictions made on individual user entries. We show that this approach is promising and that it can be a viable alternative to the current human process that Wikipedia uses to resolve suspected sockpuppet cases.\n",

      "Towards Automatic Distinction between Specialized and Non-Specialized Occurrences of Verbs in Medical Corpora. The medical field gathers people of different social statuses, such as students, pharmacists, managers, biologists, nurses and mainly medical doctors and patients, who represent the main actors. Despite their different levels of expertise, these actors need to interact and understand each other but the communication is not always easy and effective. This paper describes a method for a contrastive automatic analysis of verbs in medical corpora, based on the semantic annotation of the verbs nominal co-occurents. The corpora used are specialized in cardiology and distinguished according to their levels of expertise (high and low). The semantic annotation of these corpora is performed by using an existing medical terminology. The results indicate that the same verbs occurring in the two corpora show different specialization levels, which are indicated by the words (nouns and adjectives derived from medical terms) they occur with.\n",

Using a novel dataset of 6,227 Singapore Supreme Court judgments, we investigate how state-of-the-art NLP methods compare against traditional statistical models when applied to a legal corpus that comprised few but lengthy documents. All approaches tested, including topic model, word embedding, and language model-based classifiers, performed well with as little as a few hundred judgments. However, more work needs to be done to optimize state-of-the-art methods for the legal domain.\n",

      "Compiling an Interactive Literary Translation Web Site for Education Purposes. The project under discussion represents an attempt to exploit the potential of web resources for higher education and, more particularly, on a domain (that of literary translation) which is traditionally considered not very much in relation to technology and computer science. Translation and Interpreting students at the Universidad de MÃ¡laga are offered the possibility to take an English-Spanish Literary Translation module, which epitomises the need for debate in the field of Humanities. Sadly enough, implementation of course methodology is rendered very difficult or impossible owing to time restrictions and overcrowded classrooms. It is our contention that the setting up of a web site may solve some of these issues. We intend to provide both students and the literary translation-aware Internet audience with an integrated, scalable, multifunctional debate forum. Project contents will include a detailed course description, relevant reference materials and interaction services (mailing list, debate forum and chat rooms). This is obviously without limitation, as the Forum is open to any other contents that users may consider necessary or convenient, with a view to a more interdisciplinary approach, further research on the field of Literary Translation and future developments within the project framework.\n",

Moreover, individuals who are prone to spread fake news online often share common traits. Building on these ideas, we introduce a model that creates representations of individuals on social media based only on the language they produce, and use them to detect fake news. We show that language-based user representations are beneficial for this task. We also present an extended analysis of the language of fake news spreaders, showing that its main features are mostly domain independent and consistent across two English datasets. Finally, we exploit the relation between language use and connections in the social graph to assess the presence of the Echo Chamber effect in our data.\n",

LARA (Learning and Reading Assistant) is an open source platform whose purpose is to support easy conversion of plain texts into multimodal online versions suitable for use by language learners. This involves semi-automatically tagging the text, adding other annotations and recording audio. The platform is suitable for creating texts in multiple languages via crowdsourcing techniques that can be used for teaching a language via reading and listening. We present results of initial experiments by various collaborators where we measure the time required to produce substantial LARA resources, up to the length of short novels, in Dutch, English, Farsi, French, German, Icelandic, Irish, Swedish and Turkish. The first results are encouraging. Although there are some startup problems, the conversion task seems manageable for the languages tested so far.

Eye tracking studies from the past few decades have shaped the way we think of word complexity and cognitive load: words that are long, rare and ambiguous are more difficult to read. However, online processing techniques have been scarcely applied to investigating the reading difficulties of people with autism and what vocabulary is challenging for them. We present parallel gaze data obtained from adult readers with autism and a control group of neurotypical readers and show that the former required higher cognitive effort to comprehend the texts as evidenced by three gaze-based measures. We divide all words into four classes based on their viewing times for both groups and investigate the relationship between longer viewing times and word length, word frequency, and four cognitively-based measures (word concreteness, familiarity, age of acquisition and imagability).\n",

      "Extracting Symptoms and their Status from Clinical Conversations. This paper describes novel models tailored for a new application, that of extracting the symptoms mentioned in clinical conversations along with their status. Lack of any publicly available corpus in this privacy-sensitive domain led us to develop our own corpus, consisting of about 3K conversations annotated by professional medical scribes. We propose two novel deep learning approaches to infer the symptom names and their status: (1) a new hierarchical span-attribute tagging (SA-T) model, trained using curriculum learning, and (2) a variant of sequence-to-sequence model which decodes the symptoms and their status from a few speaker turns within a sliding window over the conversation. This task stems from a realistic application of assisting medical providers in capturing symptoms mentioned by patients from their clinical conversations. To reflect this application, we define multiple metrics. From inter-rater agreement, we find that the task is inherently difficult. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on several contrasting conditions and observe that the performance of the models range from an F-score of 0.5 to 0.8 depending on the condition. Our analysis not only reveals the inherent challenges of the task, but also provides useful directions to improve the models.\n",

Unsupervised discovery of lexical units would facilitate the annotation process and thus lead to better SLR systems. Inspired by the unsupervised spoken term discovery in speech processing field, we investigate whether a similar approach can be applied in sign language to discover repeating lexical units. We adapt an algorithm that is designed for spoken term discovery by using hand shape and pose features instead of speech features. The experiments are run on a large scale continuous sign corpus and the performance is evaluated using gloss level annotations. This work introduces a new task for sign language processing that has not been addressed before.\n",

      "Improving Relevance Quality in Product Search using High-Precision Query-Product Semantic Similarity. Ensuring relevance quality in product search is a critical task as it impacts the customer's ability to find intended products in the short-term as well as the general perception and trust of the e-commerce system in the long term. In this work we leverage a high-precision crossencoder BERT model for semantic similarity between customer query and products and survey its effectiveness for three ranking applications where offline-generated scores could be used: (1) as an offline metric for estimating relevance quality impact, (2) as a re-ranking feature covering head/torso queries, and (3) as a training objective for optimization. We present results on effectiveness of this strategy for the large e-commerce setting, which has general applicability for choice of other high-precision models and tasks in ranking.\n",

      "MEDAR: Collaboration between European and Mediterranean Arabic Partners to Support the Development of Language Technology for Arabic. After the successful completion of the NEMLAR project 2003-2005, a new opportunity for a project was opened by the European Commission, and a group of largely the same partners is now executing the MEDAR project. MEDAR will be updating the surveys and BLARK for Arabic already made, and will then focus on machine translation (and other tools for translation) and information retrieval with a focus on language resources, tools and evaluation for these applications. A very important part of the MEDAR project is to reinforce and extend the NEMLAR network and to create a cooperation roadmap for Human Language Technologies for Arabic. It is expected that the cooperation roadmap will attract wide attention from other parties and that it can help create a larger platform for collaborative projects. Finally, the project will focus on dissemination of knowledge about existing resources and tools, as well as actors and activities; this will happen through newsletter, website and an international conference which will follow up on the Cairo conference of 2004. Dissemination to user communities will also be important, e.g. through participation in translators' conferences.

In this paper, we explore the relation between stylistic and syntactic features and authors' age and income. We confirm our hypothesis that for numerous feature types writing style is predictive of income even beyond age. We analyze the predictive power of writing style features in a regression task on two data sets of around 5,000 Twitter users each. Additionally, we use our validated features to study daily variations in writing style of users from distinct income groups. Temporal stylistic patterns not only provide novel psychological insight into user behavior, but are useful for future research and applications in social media.\n",

Recent events, such as the 2016 US Presidential Campaign, Brexit and the COVID-19 \"infodemic\", have brought into the spotlight the dangers of online disinformation. There has been a lot of research focusing on factchecking and disinformation detection. However, little attention has been paid to the specific rhetorical and psychological techniques used to convey propaganda messages. Revealing the use of such techniques can help promote media literacy and critical thinking, and eventually contribute to limiting the impact of \"fake news\" and disinformation campaigns. Prta (Propaganda Persuasion Techniques Analyzer) allows users to explore the articles crawled on a regular basis by highlighting the spans in which propaganda techniques occur and to compare them on the basis of their use of propaganda techniques. The system further reports statistics about the use of such techniques, overall and over time, or according to filtering criteria specified by the user based on time interval, keywords, and/or political orientation of the media.

      "Conversation Initiation by Diverse News Contents Introduction. In our everyday chitchat , there is a conversation initiator, who proactively casts an initial utterance to start chatting. However, most existing conversation systems cannot play this role. Previous studies on conversation systems assume that the user always initiates conversation, and have placed emphasis on how to respond to the given user's utterance. As a result, existing conversation systems become passive. Namely they continue waiting until being spoken to by the users. In this paper, we consider the system as a conversation initiator and propose a novel task of generating the initial utterance in open-domain non-task-oriented conversation. Here, in order not to make users bored, it is necessary to generate diverse utterances to initiate conversation without relying on boilerplate utterances like greetings. To this end, we propose to generate initial utterance by summarizing and chatting about news articles, which provide fresh and various contents everyday. To address the lack of the training data for this task, we constructed a novel largescale dataset through crowd-sourcing. We also analyzed the dataset in detail to examine how humans initiate conversations (the dataset will be released to facilitate future research activities). We present several approaches to conversation initiation including information retrieval based and generation based models. Experimental results showed that the proposed models trained on our dataset performed reasonably well and outperformed baselines that utilize automatically collected training data in both automatic and manual evaluation. * This work was done during research internship at Yahoo Japan Corporation. 1 \"Conversation\" in this paper refers to open-domain nontask-oriented conversations and chitchat .\n",

      "Categorizing Offensive Language in Social Networks: A Chinese Corpus, Systems and an Explainable Tool. Recently, more and more data have been generated in the online world, filled with offensive language such as threats, swear words or straightforward insults. It is disgraceful for a progressive society, and then the question arises on how language resources and technologies can cope with this challenge. However, previous work only analyzes the problem as a whole but fails to detect particular types of offensive content in a more fine-grained way, mainly because of the lack of annotated data. In this work, we present a densely annotated data-set COLA (Categorizing Offensive LAnguage), consists of fine-grained insulting language, antisocial language and illegal language. We study different strategies for automatically identifying offensive language on COLA data. Further, we design a capsule system with hierarchical attention to aggregate and fully utilize information, which obtains a state-of-the-art result. Results from experiments prove that our hierarchical attention capsule network (HACN) performs significantly better than existing methods in offensive classification with the precision of 94.37% and recall of 95.28%. We also explain what our model has learned with an explanation tool called Integrated Gradients. Meanwhile, our system's processing speed can handle each sentence in 10msec, suggesting the potential for efficient deployment in real situations.\n",

      "Boosting Low-Resource Biomedical QA via Entity-Aware Masking Strategies. Biomedical question-answering (QA) has gained increased attention for its capability to provide users with high-quality information from a vast scientific literature. Although an increasing number of biomedical QA datasets has been recently made available, those resources are still rather limited and expensive to produce. Transfer learning via pre-trained language models (LMs) has been shown as a promising approach to leverage existing general-purpose knowledge. However, finetuning these large models can be costly and time consuming, often yielding limited benefits when adapting to specific themes of specialised domains, such as the COVID-19 literature. To bootstrap further their domain adaptation, we propose a simple yet unexplored approach, which we call biomedical entity-aware masking (BEM). We encourage masked language models to learn entity-centric knowledge based on the pivotal entities characterizing the domain at hand, and employ those entities to drive the LM fine-tuning. The resulting strategy is a downstream process applicable to a wide variety of masked LMs, not requiring additional memory or components in the neural architectures. Experimental results show performance on par with state-of-the-art models on several biomedical QA datasets.\n",

      "A Statistical Modeling of the Correlation between Island Effects and Working-memory Capacity for L2 Learners. The cause of island effects has evoked considerable debate within syntax and other fields of linguistics. The two competing approaches stand out: the grammatical analysis; and the working-memory (WM)-based processing analysis. In this paper we report three experiments designed to test one of the premises of the WM-based processing analysis: that the strength of island effects should vary as a function of individual differences in WM capacity. The results show that island effects present even for L2 learners are more likely attributed to grammatical constraints than to limited processing resources.\n",

      "A Large-Scale English Multi-Label Twitter Dataset for Cyberbullying and Online Abuse Detection. In this paper, we introduce a new English Twitter-based dataset for online abuse and cyberbullying detection. Comprising 62,587 tweets, this dataset was sourced from Twitter using specific query terms designed to retrieve tweets with high probabilities of various forms of bullying and offensive content, including insult, profanity, sarcasm, threat, porn and exclusion. Analysis performed on the dataset confirmed common cyberbullying themes reported by other studies and revealed interesting relationships between the classes. The dataset was used to train a number of transformer-based deep learning models returning impressive results.\n",

      "The N2 corpus: A semantically annotated collection of Islamist extremist stories. We describe the N2 (Narrative Networks) Corpus, a new language resource. The corpus is unique in three important ways. First, every text in the corpus is a story, which is in contrast to other language resources that may contain stories or story-like texts, but are not specifically curated to contain only stories. Second, the unifying theme of the corpus is material relevant to Islamist Extremists, having been produced by or often referenced by them. Third, every text in the corpus has been annotated for 14 layers of syntax and semantics, including: referring expressions and co-reference; events, time expressions, and temporal relationships; semantic roles; and word senses. In cases where analyzers were not available to do high-quality automatic annotations, layers were manually doubleannotated and adjudicated by trained annotators. The corpus comprises 100 texts and 42,480 words. Most of the texts were originally in Arabic but all are provided in English translation. We explain the motivation for constructing the corpus, the process for selecting the texts, the detailed contents of the corpus itself, the rationale behind the choice of annotation layers, and the annotation procedure.\n",

      "Detecting Cognitive Distortions from Patient-Therapist Interactions. An important part of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is to recognize and restructure certain negative thinking patterns that are also known as cognitive distortions. This project aims to detect these distortions using natural language processing. We compare and contrast different types of linguistic features as well as different classification algorithms and explore the limitations of applying these techniques on a small dataset. We find that pretrained Sentence-BERT embeddings to train an SVM classifier yields the best results with an F1-score of 0.79.

      "Memes in the Wild: Assessing the Generalizability of the Hateful Memes Challenge Dataset. Hateful memes pose a unique challenge for current machine learning systems because their message is derived from both text-and visual-modalities. To this effect, Facebook released the Hateful Memes Challenge, a dataset of memes with pre-extracted text captions, but it is unclear whether these synthetic examples generalize to 'memes in the wild'. In this paper, we collect hateful and non-hateful memes from Pinterest to evaluate out-of-sample performance on models pre-trained on the Facebook dataset. We find that memes in the wild differ in two key aspects: 1) Captions must be extracted via OCR, injecting noise and diminishing performance of multimodal models, and 2) Memes are more diverse than 'traditional memes', including screenshots of conversations or text on a plain background. This paper thus serves as a reality check for the current benchmark of hateful meme detection and its applicability for detecting real world hate.\n",

      "Encoding Terms from a Scientific Domain in a Terminological Database: Methodology and Criteria. This paper reports on the main phases of a research which aims at enhancing a maritime terminological database by means of a set of terms belonging to meteorology. The structure of the terminological database, according to EuroWordNet/ItalWordNet model is described; the criteria used to build corpora of specialized texts are explained as well as the use of the corpora as source for term selection and extraction. The contribution of the semantic databases is taken into account: on the one hand, the most recent version of the Princeton WordNet has been exploited as reference for comparing and evaluating synsets; on the other hand, the Italian WordNet has been employed as source for exporting synsets to be coded in the terminological resource. The set of semantic relations useful to codify new terms belonging to the discipline of meteorology is examined, revising the semantic relations provided by the IWN model, introducing new relations which are more suitably tailored to specific requirements either scientific or pragmatic. The need for a particular relation is highlighted to represent the mental association which is made when a term intuitively recalls another term, but they are neither synonyms nor connected by means of a hyperonymy/hyponymy relation.\n",

      "Invited Talk: Lessons from the MALACH Project: Applying New Technologies to Improve Intellectual Access to Large Oral History Collections. In this talk I will describe the goals of the MALACH project (Multilingual Access to Large Spoken Archives) and our research results. I'll begin by describing the unique characteristics of the oral history collection that we used, in which Holocaust survivors, witnesses and rescuers were interviewed in several languages. Each interview has been digitized and extensively catalogued by subject matter experts, thus producing a remarkably rich collection for the application of machine learning techniques. Automatic speech recognition techniques originally developed for the domain of conversational telephone speech were adapted to process these materials with word error rates that are adequate to provide useful features to support interactive search and automated clustering, boundary detection, and topic classification tasks. As I describe our results, I will focus particularly on the evaluation methods that that we have used to assess the potential utility of this technology. I'll conclude with some remarks about possible future directions for research on applying new technologies to improve intellectual access to oral history and other spoken word collections.\n",

      "Contrastive Analysis with Predictive Power: Typology Driven Estimation of Grammatical Error Distributions in ESL. This work examines the impact of crosslinguistic transfer on grammatical errors in English as Second Language (ESL) texts. Using a computational framework that formalizes the theory of Contrastive Analysis (CA), we demonstrate that language specific error distributions in ESL writing can be predicted from the typological properties of the native language and their relation to the typology of English. Our typology driven model enables to obtain accurate estimates of such distributions without access to any ESL data for the target languages. Furthermore, we present a strategy for adjusting our method to low-resource languages that lack typological documentation using a bootstrapping approach which approximates native language typology from ESL texts. Finally, we show that our framework is instrumental for linguistic inquiry seeking to identify first language factors that contribute to a wide range of difficulties in second language acquisition.\n",

This paper introduces the system description of the HUB team participating in Dravidian-LangTech-EACL2021: Offensive Language Identification in Dravidian Languages. The theme of this shared task is the detection of offensive content in social media. Among the known tasks related to offensive speech detection, this is the first task to detect offensive comments posted in social media comments in the Dravidian language. The task organizer team provided us with the code-mixing task data set mainly composed of three different languages: Malayalam, Kannada, and Tamil. The tasks on the code mixed data in these three different languages can be seen as three different comment/post-level classification tasks. The task on the Malayalam data set is a five-category classification task, and the Kannada and Tamil language data sets are two six-category classification tasks. Based on our analysis of the task description and task data set, we chose to use the multilingual BERT model to complete this task.

      "On the unification of syntactic annotations under the Stanford dependency scheme: A case study on BioInfer and GENIA. Several incompatible syntactic annotation schemes are currently used by parsers and corpora in biomedical information extraction. The recently introduced Stanford dependency scheme has been suggested to be a suitable unifying syntax formalism. In this paper, we present a step towards such unification by creating a conversion from the Link Grammar to the Stanford scheme. Further, we create a version of the BioInfer corpus with syntactic annotation in this scheme. We present an application-oriented evaluation of the transformation and assess the suitability of the scheme and our conversion to the unification of the syntactic annotations of BioInfer and the GENIA Treebank. We find that a highly reliable conversion is both feasible to create and practical, increasing the applicability of both the parser and the corpus to information extraction.\n",

      "A Participant-based Approach for Event Summarization Using Twitter Streams. Twitter offers an unprecedented advantage on live reporting of the events happening around the world. However, summarizing the Twitter event has been a challenging task that was not fully explored in the past. In this paper, we propose a participant-based event summarization approach that \"zooms-in\" the Twitter event streams to the participant level, detects the important sub-events associated with each participant using a novel mixture model that combines the \"burstiness\" and \"cohesiveness\" properties of the event tweets, and generates the event summaries progressively. We evaluate the proposed approach on different event types. Results show that the participantbased approach can effectively capture the sub-events that have otherwise been shadowed by the long-tail of other dominant sub-events, yielding summaries with considerably better coverage than the state-of-the-art.\n",

      "Legal NERC with ontologies, Wikipedia and curriculum learning. In this paper, we present a Wikipediabased approach to develop resources for the legal domain. We establish a mapping between a legal domain ontology, LKIF (Hoekstra et al., 2007), and a Wikipediabased ontology, YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), and through that we populate LKIF. Moreover, we use the mentions of those entities in Wikipedia text to train a specific Named Entity Recognizer and Classifier. We find that this classifier works well in the Wikipedia, but, as could be expected, performance decreases in a corpus of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. However, this tool will be used as a preprocess for human annotation. We resort to a technique called curriculum learning aimed to overcome problems of overfitting by learning increasingly more complex concepts. However, we find that in this particular setting, the method works best by learning from most specific to most general concepts, not the other way round.\n",

      "When does text prediction benefit from additional context? An exploration of contextual signals for chat and email messages. Email and chat communication tools are increasingly important for completing daily tasks. Accurate real-time phrase completion can save time and bolster productivity. Modern text prediction algorithms are based on large language models which typically rely on the prior words in a message to predict a completion. We examine how additional contextual signals (from previous messages, time, and subject) affect the performance of a commercial text prediction model. We compare contextual text prediction in chat and email messages from two of the largest commercial platforms Microsoft Teams and Outlook, finding that contextual signals contribute to performance differently between these scenarios. On emails, time context is most beneficial with small relative gains of 2% over baseline. Whereas, in chat scenarios, using a tailored set of previous messages as context yields relative improvements over the baseline between 9.3% and 18.6% across various critical serviceoriented text prediction metrics.\n",

In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of identifying rumors, i.e., fake information, out of microblog posts based on their propagation structure. We firstly model microblog posts diffusion with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how an original message is transmitted and developed over time. We then propose a kernel-based method called Propagation Tree Kernel, which captures high-order patterns differentiating different types of rumors by evaluating the similarities between their propagation tree structures. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed kernel-based approach can detect rumors more quickly and accurately than state-ofthe-art rumor detection models.\n",

Extending machine reading approaches to extract mathematical concepts and their descriptions is useful for a variety of tasks, ranging from mathematical information retrieval to increasing accessibility of scientific documents for the visually impaired. This entails segmenting mathematical formulae into identifiers and linking them to their natural language descriptions. We propose a rule-based approach for this task, which extracts L A T E X representations of formula identifiers and links them to their in-text descriptions, given only the original PDF and the location of the formula of interest.

CommandTalk is a spoken-language interface to battlefield simulations that allows the use of ordinary spoken English to create forces and control measures, assign missions to forces, modify missions during execution, and control simulation system functions. CommandTalk combines a number of separate components integrated through the use of the Open Agent Architecture, including the Nuance speech recognition system, the Gemini naturallanguage parsing and interpretation system, a contextual-interpretation modhle, a \"push-to-talk\" agent, the ModSAF battlefield simulator, and \"Start-It\" (a graphical processing-spawning agent). Com-mandTalk is installed at a number of Government and contractor sites, including NRaD and the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center. It is currently being extended to provide exercise-time control of all simulated U.S. forces in DARPA's STOW 97 demonstration. Put Checkpoint 1 at 937 965. Create a point called Checkpoint 2 at 930 960. Objective Alpha is 92 96. Charlie 4 5, at my command, advance in a column to Checkpoint 1. Next, proceed to Checkpoint 2. Then assault Objective Alpha.

The best-performed model on the test sets were trained on a merged corpus consisting of the datasets released by SMM4H 2017 and 2019. By using VUE, the corpus was randomly under-sampled with 2:1 ratio between the negative and positive classes to create an ensemble using the linear kernel trained with features including bag-of-word, domain knowledge, negation and word embedding. The best performing model achieved an F-measure of 0.551 which is about 5% higher than the average F-scores of 16 teams.\n",

      "Analyzing Stereotypes in Generative Text Inference Tasks. Stereotypes are inferences drawn about people based on their demographic attributes, which may result in harms to users when a system is deployed. In generative language-inference tasks, given a premise, a model produces plausible hypotheses that follow either logically (natural language inference) or commonsensically (commonsense inference). Such tasks are therefore a fruitful setting in which to explore the degree to which NLP systems encode stereotypes. In our work, we study how stereotypes manifest when the potential targets of stereotypes are situated in real-life, neutral contexts. We collect human judgments on the presence of stereotypes in generated inferences, and compare how perceptions of stereotypes vary due to annotator positionality.

We explore model variations considering single and multiple languages both in the pre-training of the transformer and in the training of the downstream task to explore the feasibility of detecting misogyny through a transfer learning approach across multiple languages. That is, we train monolingual transformers with monolingual data and multilingual transformers with both monolingual and multilingual data. Our models reach state-of-the-art performance on all three languages. The single-language BERT models perform the best, closely followed by different configurations of multilingual BERT models. The performance drops in zero-shot classification across languages. Our error analysis shows that multilingual and monolingual models tend to make the same mistakes.\n",

      "Collaborative Data Relabeling for Robust and Diverse Voice Apps Recommendation in Intelligent Personal Assistants. Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple Siri extend their built-in capabilities by supporting voice apps developed by third-party developers. Sometimes the smart assistant is not able to successfully respond to user voice commands (aka utterances). There are many reasons including automatic speech recognition (ASR) error, natural language understanding (NLU) error, routing utterances to an irrelevant voice app or simply that the user is asking for a capability that is not supported yet. The failure to handle a voice command leads to customer frustration. In this paper, we introduce a fallback skill recommendation system to suggest a voice app to a customer for an unhandled voice command. One of the prominent challenges of developing a skill recommender system for IPAs is partial observation. To solve the partial observation problem, we propose collaborative data relabeling (CDR) method. In addition, CDR also improves the diversity of the recommended skills. We evaluate the proposed method both offline and online. The offline evaluation results show that the proposed system outperforms the baselines. The online A/B testing results show significant gain of customer experience metrics.\n",

      "Statistical Machine Translation Models for Personalized Search. Web search personalization has been well studied in the recent few years. Relevance feedback has been used in various ways to improve relevance of search results. In this paper, we propose a novel usage of relevance feedback to effectively model the process of query formulation and better characterize how a user relates his query to the document that he intends to retrieve using a noisy channel model. We model a user profile as the probabilities of translation of query to document in this noisy channel using the relevance feedback obtained from the user. The user profile thus learnt is applied in a re-ranking phase to rescore the search results retrieved using an underlying search engine. We evaluate our approach by conducting experiments using relevance feedback data collected from users using a popular search engine. The results have shown improvement over baseline, proving that our approach can be applied to personalization of web search. The experiments have also resulted in some valuable observations that learning these user profiles using snippets surrounding the results for a query gives better performance than learning from entire document collection.\n",

Existing models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for sentence classification often do not incorporate the context in which sentences appear, and classify sentences individually. However, traditional sentence classification approaches have been shown to greatly benefit from jointly classifying subsequent sentences, such as with conditional random fields. In this work, we present an ANN architecture that combines the effectiveness of typical ANN models to classify sentences in isolation, with the strength of structured prediction. Our model outperforms the state-ofthe-art results on two different datasets for sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts.\n",

      "Interpretable Propaganda Detection in News Articles. Online users today are exposed to misleading and propagandistic news articles and media posts on a daily basis. To counter thus, a number of approaches have been designed aiming to achieve a healthier and safer online news and media consumption. Automatic systems are able to support humans in detecting such content; yet, a major impediment to their broad adoption is that besides being accurate, the decisions of such systems need also to be interpretable in order to be trusted and widely adopted by users. Since misleading and propagandistic content influences readers through the use of a number of deception techniques, we propose to detect and to show the use of such techniques as a way to offer interpretability. In particular, we define qualitatively descriptive features and we analyze their suitability for detecting deception techniques. We further show that our interpretable features can be easily combined with pre-trained language models, yielding state-of-the-art results.\n",

The model is trained to handle four tasks: detecting news bias, clickbait, fake news and verifying rumors. By grouping these tasks together, UNIFIEDM2 learns a richer representation of misinformation, which leads to stateof-the-art or comparable performance across all tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that UNIFIEDM2's learned representation is helpful for few-shot learning of unseen misinformation tasks/datasets and model's generalizability to unseen events. * Work partially done while interning at Facebook AI. â€  Work partially done while working at Facebook AI.\n",

      "Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Models for Clinical Document Coding. The automatic coding of clinical documents is an important task for today's healthcare providers. Though it can be viewed as multi-label document classification, the coding problem has the interesting property that most code assignments can be supported by a single phrase found in the input document. We propose a Lexically-Triggered Hidden Markov Model (LT-HMM) that leverages these phrases to improve coding accuracy. The LT-HMM works in two stages: first, a lexical match is performed against a term dictionary to collect a set of candidate codes for a document. Next, a discriminative HMM selects the best subset of codes to assign to the document by tagging candidates as present or absent. By confirming codes proposed by a dictionary, the LT-HMM can share features across codes, enabling strong performance even on rare codes. In fact, we are able to recover codes that do not occur in the training set at all. Our approach achieves the best ever performance on the 2007 Medical NLP Challenge test set, with an F-measure of 89.84.\n",

      "Faceted Hierarchy: A New Graph Type to Organize Scientific Concepts and a Construction Method. On a scientific concept hierarchy, a parent concept may have a few attributes, each of which has multiple values being a group of child concepts. We call these attributes facets: classification has a few facets such as application (e.g., face recognition), model (e.g., svm, knn), and metric (e.g., precision). In this work, we aim at building faceted concept hierarchies from scientific literature. Hierarchy construction methods heavily rely on hypernym detection, however, the faceted relations are parent-to-child links but the hypernym relation is a multi-hop, i.e., ancestor-todescendent link with a specific facet \"type-of\". We use information extraction techniques to find synonyms, sibling concepts, and ancestordescendent relations from a data science corpus. And we propose a hierarchy growth algorithm to infer the parent-child links from the three types of relationships. It resolves conflicts by maintaining the acyclic structure of a hierarchy.\n",

Due to the increasing concerns for data privacy, source-free unsupervised domain adaptation attracts more and more research attention, where only a trained source model is assumed to be available, while the labeled source data remains private. To get promising adaptation results, we need to find effective ways to transfer knowledge learned in source domain and leverage useful domain specific information from target domain at the same time. This paper describes our winning contribution to SemEval 2021 Task 10: Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Semantic Processing. Our key idea is to leverage the model trained on source domain data to generate pseudo labels for target domain samples.

We explore using contextual information from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to describe the possible senses of a word. We experiment with automatically creating individualized stoplists to help reduce the noise in our dataset. We compare our results to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al.

      "Extracting Fine-Grained Economic Events from Business News. Based on a recently developed fine-grained event extraction dataset for the economic domain, we present in a pilot study for supervised economic event extraction. We investigate how a stateof-the-art model for event extraction performs on the trigger and argument identification and classification. While F 1-scores of above 50% are obtained on the task of trigger identification, we observe a large gap in performance compared to results on the benchmark ACE05 dataset. We show that single-token triggers do not provide sufficient discriminative information for a finegrained event detection setup in a closed domain such as economics, since many classes have a large degree of lexico-semantic and contextual overlap.\n",

We use sentence embeddings and speaker identities as features, and experiment with linear chain CRFs and RNNs with a CRF layer (LSTM-CRF). Both the linear chain CRF model and the LSTM-CRF model outperform the naÃ¯ve baselines by a large margin, and LSTM-CRF has an edge between the two.

      "Linguistic and Acoustic Features for Automatic Identification of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Children's Narrative. Autism spectrum disorders are developmental disorders characterised as deficits in social and communication skills, and they affect both verbal and non-verbal communication. Previous works measured differences in children with and without autism spectrum disorders in terms of linguistic and acoustic features, although they do not mention automatic identification using integration of these features. In this paper, we perform an exploratory study of several language and speech features of both single utterances and full narratives. We find that there are characteristic differences between children with autism spectrum disorders and typical development with respect to word categories, prosody, and voice quality, and that these differences can be used in automatic classifiers. We also examine the differences between American and Japanese children and find significant differences with regards to pauses before new turns and linguistic cues.\n",

Natural language inference (NLI) is challenging, especially when it is applied to technical domains such as biomedical settings. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to biomedical NLI where different types of information are exploited for this task. Our base model includes a pre-trained text encoder as the core component, and a syntax encoder and a feature encoder to capture syntactic and domain-specific information. Then we combine the output of different base models to form more powerful ensemble models. Finally, we design two conflict resolution strategies when the test data contain multiple (premise, hypothesis) pairs with the same premise. We train our models on the MedNLI dataset, yielding the best performance on the test set of the MEDIQA 2019 Task 1.\n",

This paper is about Translation Dictation with ASR, that is, the use of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) by human translators, in order to dictate translations. We are particularly interested in the productivity gains that this could provide over conventional keyboard input, and ways in which such gains might be increased through a combination of ASR and Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). In this hybrid technology, the source language text is presented to both the human translator and a SMT system. The latter produces Nbest translations hypotheses, which are then used to fine tune the ASR language model and vocabulary towards utterances which are probable translations of source text sentences. We conducted an ergonomic experiment with eight professional translators dictating into French, using a top of the line offthe-shelf ASR system (Dragon NatuallySpeaking 8). We found that the ASR system had an average Word Error Rate (WER) of 11.7%, and that translation using this system did not provide statistically significant productivity increases over keyboard input, when following the manufacturer recommended procedure for error correction. However, we found indications that, even in its current imperfect state, French ASR might be beneficial to translators who are already used to dictation (either with ASR or a dictaphone), but more focused experiments are needed to confirm this. We also found that dictation using an ASR with WER of 4% or less would have resulted in statistically significant (p < 0.6) productivity gains in the order of 25.1% to 44.9% Translated Words Per Minute. We also evaluated the extent to which the limited manufacturer provided Domain Adaptation features could be used to positively bias the ASR using SMT hypotheses. We found that the relative gains in WER were much lower than has been reported in the literature for tighter integration of SMT with ASR, pointing the advantages of tight integration approaches and the need for more research in that area.\n",

In this paper, we describe our system submitted to SemEval 2021 Task 7: HaHackathon: Detecting and Rating Humor and Offense. The task aims at predicting whether the given text is humorous, the average humor rating given by the annotators, and whether the humor rating is controversial. In addition, the task also involves predicting how offensive the text is. Our approach adopts the DeBERTa architecture with disentangled attention mechanism, where the attention scores between words are calculated based on their content vectors and relative position vectors. We also took advantage of the pre-trained language models and fine-tuned the DeBERTa model on all the four subtasks. We experimented with several BERT-like structures and found that the large DeBERTa model generally performs better. During the evaluation phase, our system achieved an F-score of 0.9480 on subtask 1a, an RMSE of 0.5510 on subtask 1b, an F-score of 0.4764 on subtask 1c, and an RMSE of 0.4230 on subtask 2a (rank 3 on the leaderboard).\n",

We populate our ontology by querying the linked open datasets for extracting instances from these resources.

User-generated textual data is rich in content and has been used in many user behavioral modeling tasks. However, it could also leak user private-attribute information that they may not want to disclose such as age and location. User's privacy concerns mandate data publishers to protect privacy. One effective way is to anonymize the textual data. In this paper, we study the problem of textual data anonymization and propose a novel Reinforcement Learning-based Text Anonymizor, RLTA, which addresses the problem of private-attribute leakage while preserving the utility of textual data. Our approach first extracts a latent representation of the original text w.r.t. a given task, then leverages deep reinforcement learning to automatically learn an optimal strategy for manipulating text representations w.r.t. the received privacy and utility feedback. Experiments show the effectiveness of this approach in terms of preserving both privacy and utility.\n",

Media organizations bear great reponsibility because of their considerable influence on shaping beliefs and positions of our society. Any form of media can contain overly biased content, e.g., by reporting on political events in a selective or incomplete manner. A relevant question hence is whether and how such form of imbalanced news coverage can be exposed. The research presented in this paper addresses not only the automatic detection of bias but goes one step further in that it explores how political bias and unfairness are manifested linguistically. In this regard we utilize a new corpus of 6964 news articles with labels derived from adfontesmedia.com and develop a neural model for bias assessment. By analyzing this model on article excerpts, we find insightful bias patterns at different levels of text granularity, from single words to the whole article discourse.\n",

Sequence labeling is a widely used method for named entity recognition and information extraction from unstructured natural language data. In the clinical domain one major application of sequence labeling involves extraction of relevant entities such as medication, indication, and side-effects from Electronic Health Record Narratives. Sequence labeling in this domain presents its own set of challenges and objectives. In this work we experiment with Conditional Random Field based structured learning models with Recurrent Neural Networks. We extend the previously studied CRF-LSTM model with explicit modeling of pairwise potentials. We also propose an approximate version of skip-chain CRF inference with RNN potentials.

      "Enhancing Dialogue Symptom Diagnosis with Global Attention and Symptom Graph. Symptom diagnosis is a challenging yet profound problem in natural language processing. Most previous research focus on investigating the standard electronic medical records for symptom diagnosis, while the dialogues between doctors and patients that contain more rich information are not well studied. In this paper, we first construct a dialogue symptom diagnosis dataset based on an online medical forum with a large amount of dialogues between patients and doctors. Then, we provide some benchmark models on this dataset to boost the research of dialogue symptom diagnosis. In order to further enhance the performance of symptom diagnosis over dialogues, we propose a global attention mechanism to capture more symptom related information, and build a symptom graph to model the associations between symptoms rather than treating each symptom independently. Experimental results show that both the global attention and symptom graph are effective to boost dialogue symptom diagnosis. In particular, our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the constructed dataset.\n",

      "Automatic Extraction of Reasoning Chains from Textual Reports. Many organizations possess large collections of textual reports that document how a problem is solved or analysed, e.g. medical patient records, industrial accident reports, lawsuit records and investigation reports. Effective use of expert knowledge contained in these reports may greatly increase productivity of the organization. In this article, we propose a method for automatic extraction of reasoning chains that contain information used by the author of a report to analyse the problem at hand. For this purpose, we developed a graph-based text representation that makes the relations between textual units explicit. This representation is acquired automatically from a report using natural language processing tools including syntactic and discourse parsers. When applied to aviation investigation reports, our method generates reasoning chains that reveal the connection between initial information about the aircraft incident and its causes.\n",

To handle the small size of published datasets on the target aspect of scores, we propose a multi-task approach to leverage additional information from other aspects of scores for improving the performance of the target aspect. Because one of the problems of building multi-task models is how to select the proper resources of auxiliary tasks and how to select the proper shared structures, we thus propose a multi-task shared structure encoding approach that automatically selects good shared network structures as well as good auxiliary resources. The experiments based on peer-review datasets show that our approach is effective and has better performance on the target scores than the single-task method and naÃ¯ve multi-task methods.\n",

This paper presents the process of development and the characteristics of an evaluation collection for a personalisation system for digital newspapers. This system selects, adapts and presents contents according to a user model that define information needs. The collection presented here contains data that are cross-related over four different axes: a set of news items from an electronic newspaper, collected into subsets corresponding to a particular sequence of days, packaged together and cross-indexed with a set of user profiles that represent the particular evolution of interests of a set of real users over the given days, expressed in each case according to four different representation frameworks: newspaper sections, Yahoo categories, keywords, and relevance feedback over the set of news items for the previous day. This information provides a minimum starting material over which one can evaluate for a given system how it addresses the first two observations-adapting to different users and adapting to particular users over time-providing that the particular system implements the representation of information needs according to the four frameworks employed in the collection.

      "Textbook Question Answering with Multi-modal Context Graph Understanding and Self-supervised Open-set Comprehension. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm for solving the textbook question answering (TQA) task which describes more realistic QA problems compared to other recent tasks. We mainly focus on two related issues with analysis of the TQA dataset. First, solving the TQA problems requires to comprehend multimodal contexts in complicated input data. To tackle this issue of extracting knowledge features from long text lessons and merging them with visual features, we establish a context graph from texts and images, and propose a new module f-GCN based on graph convolutional networks (GCN). Second, scientific terms are not spread over the chapters and subjects are split in the TQA dataset. To overcome this so called 'out-of-domain' issue, before learning QA problems, we introduce a novel self-supervised open-set learning process without any annotations. The experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ablation studies validate that both methods of incorporating f-GCN for extracting knowledge from multi-modal contexts and our newly proposed self-supervised learning process are effective for TQA problems.\n",

      "Modeling Intensification for Sign Language Generation: A Computational Approach. End-to-end sign language generation models do not accurately represent the prosody in sign language. A lack of temporal and spatial variations leads to poor-quality generated presentations that confuse human interpreters. In this paper, we aim to improve the prosody in generated sign languages by modeling intensification in a data-driven manner. We present different strategies grounded in linguistics of sign language that inform how intensity modifiers can be represented in gloss annotations. To employ our strategies, we first annotate a subset of the benchmark PHOENIX-14T, a German Sign Language dataset, with different levels of intensification. We then use a supervised intensity tagger to extend the annotated dataset and obtain labels for the remaining portion of it. This enhanced dataset is then used to train state-of-the-art transformer models for sign language generation. We find that our efforts in intensification modeling yield better results when evaluated with automatic metrics. Human evaluation also indicates a higher preference of the videos generated using our model.\n",

The paper discusses an Information Extraction approach, which is applied for the automatic processing of hospital Patient Records (PRs) in Bulgarian language. The main task reported here is retrieval of status descriptions related to anatomical organs. Due to the specific telegraphic PR style, the approach is focused on shallow analysis. Missing text descriptions and default values are another obstacle. To overcome it, we propose an algorithm for exploring the correlations between patient status data and the corresponding diagnosis. Rules for interdependencies of the patient status data are generated by clustering according to chosen metrics. In this way it becomes possible to fill in status templates for each patient when explicit descriptions are unavailable in the text.

      "Assessing Gender Bias in Wikipedia: Inequalities in Article Titles. Potential gender biases existing in Wikipedia's content can contribute to biased behaviors in a variety of downstream NLP systems. Yet, efforts in understanding what inequalities in portraying women and men occur in Wikipedia focused so far only on biographies, leaving open the question of how often such harmful patterns occur in other topics. In this paper, we investigate gender-related asymmetries in Wikipedia titles from all domains. We assess that for only half of gender-related articles, i.e., articles with words such as women or male in their titles, symmetrical counterparts describing the same concept for the other gender (and clearly stating it in their titles) exist. Among the remaining imbalanced cases, the vast majority of articles concern sports-and social-related issues.

      "Identifying Nuances in Fake News vs. Satire: Using Semantic and Linguistic Cues. The blurry line between nefarious fake news and protected-speech satire has been a notorious struggle for social media platforms. Further to the efforts of reducing exposure to misinformation on social media, purveyors of fake news have begun to masquerade as satire sites to avoid being demoted. In this work, we address the challenge of automatically classifying fake news versus satire. Previous work have studied whether fake news and satire can be distinguished based on language differences. Contrary to fake news, satire stories are usually humorous and carry some political or social message. We hypothesize that these nuances could be identified using semantic and linguistic cues. Consequently, we train a machine learning method using semantic representation, with a state-of-the-art contextual language model, and with linguistic features based on textual coherence metrics. Empirical evaluation attests to the merits of our approach compared to the language-based baseline and sheds light on the nuances between fake news and satire. As avenues for future work, we consider studying additional linguistic features related to the humor aspect, and enriching the data with current news events, to help identify a political or social message.\n",

      "The Modulation of Cooperation and Emotion in Dialogue: The REC Corpus. In this paper we describe the Rovereto Emotive Corpus (REC) which we collected to investigate the relationship between emotion and cooperation in dialogue tasks. It is an area where still many unsolved questions are present. One of the main open issues is the annotation of the socalled \"blended\" emotions and their recognition. Usually, there is a low agreement among raters in annotating emotions and, surprisingly, emotion recognition is higher in a condition of modality deprivation (i. e. only acoustic or only visual modality vs. bimodal display of emotion). Because of these previous results, we collected a corpus in which \"emotive\" tokens are pointed out during the recordings by psychophysiological indexes (ElectroCardioGram, and Galvanic Skin Conductance). From the output values of these indexes a general recognition of each emotion arousal is allowed. After this selection we will annotate emotive interactions with our multimodal annotation scheme, performing a kappa statistic on annotation results to validate our coding scheme. In the near future, a logistic regression on annotated data will be performed to find out correlations between cooperation and negative emotions. A final step will be an fMRI experiment on emotion recognition of blended emotions from face displays.\n",

With the increase of users on social media platforms, manipulating or provoking masses of people has become a piece of cake. This spread of hatred among people, which has become a loophole for freedom of speech, must be minimized. Hence, it is essential to have a system that automatically classifies the hatred content, especially on social media, to take it down.

To overcome the limitations of the short lengths of these comments, we use an voting scheme to combine predictions made on individual user entries.
